            description: "Default tool for any structural symbol question — \"where is X defined\", \"what classes exist\", \"what methods does Widget provide\", \"what's in `crates/foo/`\". Every filter is optional and they AND together, but at least one of `query` / `kind` / `container` / `path` must be supplied (otherwise the call would dump every symbol). One call returns location, signature, kind, originating repo + branch, against an always-current index — strictly faster and lower-token than `grep`.\n\nFour shapes worth knowing:\n  • `{query: \"parse_args\"}` — name lookup. `fuzzy=true` runs an FTS5 search over name + qualified + doc; default is exact name / qualified match.\n  • `{kind: \"class\"}` — list every class (or struct / trait / enum / function / method / …) in scope. Pair with `path` to scope by directory.\n  • `{container: \"Widget\"}` — list Widget's members (methods + nested types). `include_inherited=true` walks the impl/inherit chain and unions in inherited members; on a syntactic-only snapshot the response is reported as `partial` because impls is a Tier-2 fact.\n  • `{path: \"crates/foo/\"}` — file-path prefix scope; combines with the others.\n\nDefaults: `repo=None` searches every registered repo (hits carry their `repo`); `branch=None` searches every indexed branch (hits carry their `branch`). `limit` defaults to 50 and the response is `completeness: partial` (reason names the cap) when more matches exist — raise `limit` to see them. Fall back to `grep` only for free-form text inside symbol bodies.".into(),
